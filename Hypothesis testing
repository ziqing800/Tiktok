# Conduct a two-sample t-test
# State the null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis
# Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the mean number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or sampling variability).
# Alternate hypothesis: There is a difference in the mean number of views between TikTok videos posted by verified accounts and TikTok videos posted by unverified accounts (any observed difference in the sample data is due to an actual difference in the corresponding population means).
# Choose 5% as the significance level

# Conduct a two-sample t-test to compare means

verified=data[data["verified_status"]=='verified']['video_view_count']
stats.ttest_ind(not_verified,verified,equal_var=False)

# Since the p-value is extremely small (much smaller than the significance level of 5%), reject the null hypothesis. 
# Conclusion: There is a statistically significant difference in the mean video view count between verified and unverified accounts on TikTok.
